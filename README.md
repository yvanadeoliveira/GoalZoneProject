# GoalZone Fitness Club â€“ Class Attendance Prediction

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project explores predictive analytics for class attendance at a fitness club, using the **GoalZone dataset**. The objective is to analyze member behavior, identify key patterns, and build machine learning models that accurately predict whether a member will attend a class.

This work was submitted as part of the **Applied Data Analytics** module.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Understand trends in class attendance.
- Explore relationships between member attributes and attendance.
- Preprocess and transform the data for modeling.
- Build and evaluate three different machine learning models.
- Recommend the best-performing model for practical use.

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors)
- **CRISP-DM** Methodology

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

Binary Classification (Attendance vs. No-Show)

Model Comparison based on Accuracy and Confusion Matrix

Clear insights and final recommendation

## ðŸ“Œ Key Findings

Members who book closer to the class date tend to attend more.

Longer-term members (over 24 months) show slightly higher attendance rates.

Morning classes (AM) tend to have higher no-show rates compared to PM.

Feature importance analysis shows days_before, months_as_member, and category as top predictors.

Random Forest is the recommended model due to its accuracy and reliability in identifying no-shows.

## âœ… Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in operational decisions by predicting no-shows. GoalZone can now improve scheduling, optimize class sizes, and offer a better experience to active members.
