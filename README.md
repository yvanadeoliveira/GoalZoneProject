# GoalZone Fitness Club â€“ Class Attendance Prediction

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project explores predictive analytics for class attendance at a fitness club, using the **GoalZone dataset**. The objective is to analyze member behavior, identify key patterns, and build machine learning models that accurately predict whether a member will attend a class.

This work was submitted as part of the **Applied Data Analytics** module.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Understand trends in class attendance.
- Explore relationships between member attributes and attendance.
- Preprocess and transform the data for modeling.
- Build and evaluate three different machine learning models.
- Recommend the best-performing model for practical use.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Findings
Previous No-Shows is a strong predictor of future attendance â€“ members who previously missed classes are more likely to do so again.

Member Type, Visit Time, and Class Type were also associated with attendance behavior.

The dataset had a mild class imbalance, favoring attendance over no-show.

Among the three models tested:

Random Forest performed best with ~81% accuracy.

Logistic Regression achieved ~76% accuracy.

K-Nearest Neighbors underperformed due to sensitivity to high-dimensionality and class imbalance.

Random Forest is the recommended model due to its accuracy and reliability in identifying no-shows.
